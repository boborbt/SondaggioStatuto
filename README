SondaggioStatuto is a program that implements a simple poll system. The system has
been used to ask people at the University of Turin to express their opinion
regarding the new Statuto that was being drafted at that time. It allows
people having a valid email address to choose among several possible alternatives
to a number of questions. The system ensures that each voter can vote only once
and that votes cannot be traced back to voters (that is, it ensures anonymity
and unicity of the votes).
